# AoC 2022

---

My solutions for [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

This year I'll be doing it in python (again) as I'm not confident enough to use rust or any other language _yet_.

### how to run:

Run ``main.py`` and input the day and part you want to solve,

Or you can run the relevant file as a script.

To replace my input by yours simply replace the ``input.txt`` file in the day you want to run.

### my thoughts on each day

A bit of text describing my experience with creating a solution for a specific day.

* day 1: It's the first day, and it shows in its easiness.

* day 2: I may or may not have abused the ``ord`` function.

* day 3: I love sets, and they love me.

Thanks for reading!
